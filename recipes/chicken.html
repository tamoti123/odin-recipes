        <h3>Steps to prepare/Method</h3>
        <strong>Step 1</strong>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li> Put the chicken in a bowl</li>
            <li> Pare strips of zest from the lemon using a vegetable peeler,then juice the lemon too.</li>
            <li>Add the peel and half the juice to the chicken, along with the oregano (if using), garlic, cinnamon and oil.</li>
            <li> Mix well, cover and chill for an hour.The lemon juice will start to ‘cook’ the chicken, so don’t leave for longer.</li>
        </ol> 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Step 2</strong>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the barbecue. If you are using coals, wait until they turn white. If you are indoors,heat a griddle pan.</li>
            <li>Thread the chicken strips onto a couple of metal skewers to stop them falling 
                through the grate (you don’t need to do this for the griddle)</li>
            <li>Then grill for a couple of mins each side.</li>
            <li>The strips will cook through quickly so don’t leave them too long. Season if you like.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p> 
    <strong>Step 3</strong>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Warm the flatbreads on the edge of the barbecue (or on the griddle) for a minute, </li>
        <li> then transfer them to plates and spread each with ½ tbsp yogurt.</li>
        <li>Divide the chicken strips between them, then dot on the remaining yogurt and sprinkle over the pepper and lettuce.</li>
        <li>Fold or roll the flatbreads to eat.</li>
    </ol>
